<b>Acknowledgment.</b><a name="1"></a>

The core idea of described CAPTCHA mechanism (using PoW alongside with
optical recognition CAPTCHA) was taken from <a href="https://github.com/Karasiq/nanoboard">nanoboard project</a>.

<b>Rationale.</b><a name="2"></a>

I will propose a decentralized CAPTCHA mechanism using imageboard as
example. But it is suitable not only for imageboards, of course, but for
all kinds of forums, blogs, etc.

"We have ZeroID. Why do we need CAPTCHA at all? A zite owner can easily ban
evil users by their IDs and thus stop spam from them", you can say.

Here my reasons why we need alternative to ZeroID:

1. ZeroID is centralized what is contradics the philosophy of ZeroNet.
Yes, there are can be other identification sites. I conciously write
"site", not "zite", because it works in an old centralized manner, you need
a dedicated server which signs users certificates. Centralized server can
be hacked/DDoSed/sized by goverment and their owners arrested. Thus the
whole project can be easily destroyed, it is only needed to take off the
game a small number of owners of identity sites.

2. ZeroID facilitates a mass surveillance. You posts on imageboard can be
easily linked together. And even linked with other posts on ZeroTalk or
your account on ZeroMe, if you are not using different identities for every
zite. You must use different ID for every post on imageboard to be
anonymous which is inconvenient.

This problem can solve automatically created self-signed certificates for
every new post to protect anonymity and proposed decentralized CAPTCHA to
protect imageboard from spam. Self-signed certificates implementation you
can see on <a href="https://bit.no.com:43110/16KzwuSAjFnivNimSHuRdPrYd1pNPhuHqN/">Nanasi text board</a>.
