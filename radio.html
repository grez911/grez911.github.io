<b>Creating an internet radio station on Debian 8 with Airtime and Icecast 2.</b>

<b>Prerequisites:</b>
1. System with at least 512 MB RAM, 1 GHz CPU, 10 Gb free disk space;
2. Clean Debian 8.6 installation (from netinstall amd64 iso, with only ssh
   server and standard system utilities, of course without desktop
   environment);
3. One available IP address;
4. Domain names "copypasta.fm" and "airtime.copypasta.fm" (I will use
   these domains) pointing to this IP address (for testing you can use
   local ip address and appropriate records in the hosts file).

<b>Installation</b>

As you <a href="https://sourcefabric.booktype.pro/airtime-25-for-broadcasters/preparing-the-server/">can see</a>: "The recommended Airtime server platform is Debian 7.2
'wheezy'". But actually you can install Airtime on Debian 8.6 'Jessie', I
will show you how.

1. Open /etc/apt/sources.list and append this:

deb http://apt.sourcefabric.org/ wheezy main

2. apt-get update
You will see this error: "W: GPG error: http://apt.sourcefabric.org wheezy
InRelease: The following signatures couldn't be verified because the public
key is not available: NO_PUBKEY 0888FE5B174C1854". We will fix this.

3. apt-get install sourcefabric-keyring 
On question "Install these packages without verification? [y/N]" type "y"
and press Enter.

4. apt-get update
Update your computer's software sources again.

5. apt-get install gdebi

6. wget https://grez911.github.io/files/mp3gain_1.5.2-r2-6_amd64.deb

7. gdebi
